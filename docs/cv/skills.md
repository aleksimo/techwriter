## Skills

Skill|Level|Notes
---|---|---
**Technical documentation**|⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐|Over 9 years of writing, editing, contributing, and publishing internal and user-facing documentation
**UX Writing**|⭐⭐⭐⭐|One year after embedding this practice into the new feature workflow. Worked together with UX designers and Product Owners over prototypes and created the UI microcopy
**Docs as Code**|⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐|This is the best techdoc approach for me so far. I can solely deploy a Documentation Portal from articles in the markdown format. All I need is VSCode, Git, a web server, and a CI/CD tool (plus also a DevOps engineer with all permissions)
**Editing and proofreading**|⭐⭐⭐⭐| This is not my favorite part, yet critical one. I also established the tradition of peer reviews of pull requests in several teams
**Agile Project Management**|⭐⭐⭐⭐|I have several years of participation in planning activities, sprint management and task decomposition within Scrum and Kanban frameworks
**Teamwork**|⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐|I highly value collaborative work and believe it leads to the most effective documentation. My past experiences have shown that partnering closely with cross-functional teams enhances both the quality of the content and the overall success of the projects
**Research**|⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐|That's what I love most: finding solutions to make the documentation process easier and save time (sometimes money, also, like $15,000/year for switching from Confluence to the standalone Portal)

## Tools of trade

Tool|Level of proficiency|Notes
---|---|---
**Static Site Generators**|⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐|Worked with the following: <ul><li>[Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/)</li><li>[Backstage](https://backstage.io/)</li><li>[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)</li><li>[Readthedocs](https://about.readthedocs.com/)</li><li>[MKDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/)</li></ul> Learning another generator or documentation system won't be an issue
**Git**|⭐⭐⭐⭐|I use it daily to `push` my work and create pull requests. I know enough commands and how to set repository permissions in Bitbucket or Gitlab to avoid panicked `revert`'s
**Linters**|⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐|[Vale](https://vale.sh/) is my favourite linter to check articles' adherence to various style guides. I usually promote it within the team and beyond. Another one is [Grammarly](https://app.grammarly.com/) to check for errors and misspellings and improve the styling of my texts
**Diagramming tools**|⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐|"A picture is worth a thousand words". Thus, to create these worthy pictures and diagrams, I use various tools, mainly [diagrams.net](https://draw.io/) (former draw.io) and [Lucidchart](https://lucid.app/documents). My recent and favourite discovery is Diagrams as Code tools, like [mermaidjs](https://mermaid.js.org/), which allows me to create complex diagrams with several lines of simple code![flow diagram](/img/ipr-flow-2.jpg)
**Jira** / **Jira align**|⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐|The product that I open almost as often as the markdown editor. It's a familiar system for handling tasks, boards, and JQL requests for complex searches
**Markup languages and CSS**|⭐⭐⭐⭐|While I'm writing in markdown most of the time, sometimes I have to edit HTML/CSS, which I can read and alter with the Inspector tool, but won't use daily.
**Confluence**|⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐|I have a long history with this one. This story usually ends with switching to Docs as Code
**Style guides**|⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐|Usually, I use the [Google Style Guide](https://developers.google.com/style). Some earlier projects required knowledge of Microsoft SG. Also, I participated in the development of internal guides.
**Python**|⭐⭐| I completed a basic course some years ago and can read the code, but I need time and effort to freshen my knowledge
**Adobe Photoshop**|⭐⭐⭐|Generally, I use it for photo editing. Sometimes for screenshots, but for this matter, I prefer the macOS Preview tool
**Help Authoring Tools**|⭐⭐⭐|[Help & Manual](https://www.helpandmanual.com/), [MadCap Flare](https://www.madcapsoftware.com/products/flare/). I worked with some a long time ago and can learn again if such a need arises

## Languages

Language|Level|Notes
---|---|---
**English**|⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐|Level C2. This has been my primary tool of trade for almost 20 years (in translation and writing). And with each year, the writing becomes more concise and laconic. That also helps tremendously in UX Writing
**Polish**|⭐⭐| I am learning it since I'm based in Poland. I can read and understand, but speaking requires practice
**Dutch**|⭐|Studied it at the university but never used it professionally since. If needed for work, I'll remember it
**French**|⭐|Same as for the Dutch, but I was learning it in high school. I hope that someday, life will give me more reasons to speak it daily
