## Skills

Skill|Level|Notes
---|---|---
**Technical documentation**|⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐|9+ years of writing, editing, contributing, and publishing internal and user-facing documentation
**UX Writing**|⭐⭐⭐⭐|1 year after embedding this practice into the new feature workflow. Worked together with UX designers and Product Owners over prototypes and created the UI microcopy
**Docs as Code**|⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐|This is the best techdoc approach for me so far. I can solely deploy a Documentation Portal from articles in the markdown format. Just give me VS Code, Git, a web server, and a CI/CD tool (and maybe a DevOps engineer with all permissions)
**Editing and proofreading**|⭐⭐⭐⭐| This is not my favorite part, yet critical one. I also established the tradition of peer reviews of pull requests at my last place
**Agile Project Management**|⭐⭐⭐⭐|I have several years of participation in planning activities, sprint management, task decomposition
**Teamwork**|⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐|
**Research**|⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐|That's what I love most: finding solutions to make the documentation process easier and save time (sometimes money, also, like $15,000/year for switching from Confluence to the standalone Portal)

## Tools of trade

Tool|Level of proficiency|Notes
---|---|---
**Static Site Generators**|⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐|Worked with Docusaurus, Hugo, Readthedoc, and MKDocs. Learning how to work with similar tools won't be a problem
**Git**|⭐⭐⭐|Know how to run basic commands and set repository permissions in Bitbucket or Gitlab to avoid panicked `revert`'s
**Jira** / **Jira align**|⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐|The product that I open almost as often as the markdown editor. It's quite a familiar system for handling tasks, boards, and JQL requests for complex searches
**Markup languages and CSS**|⭐⭐⭐⭐|While I'm writing in markdown most of the time, sometimes I have to edit HTML/CSS, which I can read and alter with the Inspector tool, but won't use daily.
**Confluence**|⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐|I have a long history with this one. And the story usually ends with switching to Docs as Code
**Style guides**|⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐|Usually, I use the Google Style guide. Some earlier projects required knowing the Microsoft SG. Also, I participated in development of internal guides.
**Python**|⭐⭐| I completed a basic course some years ago and can read the code, but I need time and effort to freshen the knowledge
**Adobe Photoshop**|⭐⭐⭐|Generally, I use it for photo and screenshots editing. Sometimes for screenshots, but in this case even the macOs Preview tool is better and faster
**Help Authoring Tools**|⭐⭐⭐|Help & Manual, MadCap Flare. I worked with some a long time ago and can learn again if such a need arises

## Languages

Language|Level|Notes
---|---|---
English|⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐|My main tool of trade for eight years already. And with each year the writing becomes more concise and laconic. That also helps tremendously in UX Writing
Polish|⭐⭐|Since I'm based in Poland, I am learning it. Can read and understand but speaking requires practice
Dutch|⭐|Studied it at the universtity, but never used professionally since. If needed for work, I'll remember it
French|⭐|Same as for the Dutch, but I was learning it in high school. Hope that someday life will give me more reasons to speak it daily
