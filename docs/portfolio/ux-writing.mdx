I became part of the project during its prototyping phase, supporting the UX design team by creating an effective microcopy. The project's core focus was developing a new machine-learning model, which required careful element naming and logical flow to ensure users could navigate the model-training process seamlessly and intuitively.

The ensuing samples showcase a range of screens pertinent to various facets of the project, including:

- **Models Screens**: vital interfaces for interacting with and managing the machine-learning models. The naming and arrangement of elements were done with a focus on maintaining clarity and logic.
- **Datasets Screens**: interfaces for managing datasets used in model training. The microcopy ensures the purpose and function of each data set is easily understood.
- **Empty States Screens**: these screens were designed to maintain user engagement even with no data to display. They provide helpful information or prompts to guide the user toward the next steps.
- **User Account Screen**: interface for managing personal user account settings. The microcopy is aimed at providing clear instructions and information to facilitate smooth user interaction.

By refining the microcopy and the user interface, I aimed to provide a smooth, intuitive experience for users as they navigate the complex process of training a machine-learning model.
