Also, I'm familiar with OpenAPI and Swagger specifications. In most cases, I review and update the existing docs, but sometimes I can write them from scratch. 

See the [API](/api/) link for an example of such a task. The [specification](https://aleksimo.github.io/techwriter/redocusaurus/plugin-redoc-0.yaml) is written and rendered via [Redocly](https://redocly.com/) as part of the test assignment.
