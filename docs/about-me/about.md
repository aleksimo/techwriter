Hello, I'm Alexey (you can also call me Alex), and I've been navigating the world of technical writing for nearly a decade. Over the years, I've come to see my role not just as a writer but as a translator, distilling complex information into accessible, user-friendly language. I've made a career out of bridging the gap between technical experts and the consumers who use their innovations daily.

## Carreer

My journey began with an English language degree specializing in Translation and Interpreting. After some years as a freelance translator, I ventured into the realm of technical writing, where my unique blend of skills allowed me to communicate effectively with software developers, engineers, and end-users alike.

Throughout my career, I've worked in various Product companies on projects from game development to AI tools. I've crafted internal and end-user guides, online help pages, and API documentation. Every [project](../cv/work-xp.md) has allowed me to refine my skills and adapt my writing to different audiences and products.

My core goal is to empower users with technology, not overwhelm them. I leverage usability testing and user feedback to achieve this, crafting user-friendly documentation that simplifies complex technology.

I've always stayed up-to-date with all the latest tools and practices in technical writing. First, it was **authoring tools** like Help&Manual and Atlassian Confluence. In recent years, I've focused more on the **Docs as Code** approach and collaborative work environments, utilizing platforms like Bitbucket and Jira for version control and project management. This helps me stay connected with various stakeholders and ensures the documentation process is transparent and efficient.

The tool itself is not the key but how we wield it with our thoughts; after all, learning a new tool may take weeks, but honing the craft of innovative thinking can transform a lifetime.

Proficiency in graphic software like Adobe Photoshop, DrawIO, and Snagit enhances my written content with engaging illustrations. I incorporate diagramming tools such as MermaidJS to "write" flow steps, which then auto-render into images upon publishing.

After nine years in the field, I've come to see technical writing as a mission to unlock users' potential in harnessing technology. I anticipate contributing my passion for clear, concise, and user-focused communication to future projects.

## Personality

As a technical writer, I see **creativity** not as an optional attribute but as a vital part of my personality. It fuels my love for **collaborative brainstorming**, where diverse minds converge to create something truly unique. I find myself perpetually attracted to **trying new tools and approaches and experimenting** with different methodologies in a quest to enhance the efficiency of my work. In this constant pursuit, I aim to strike a **balance** between innovation and practicality, between tradition and the untried.

My career has required quick adaptation to incidents and varying environments, honing my resilience and flexibility. Automation has become my steadfast ally in this journey, preventing unnecessary repetition and giving me room to focus on new challenges. It aligns closely with the Japanese concept of '**Kaizen**', an idea I hold dear. Kaizen, or continuous improvement, resonates deeply with me as I constantly seek ways to refine my skills and processes, making small, incremental changes for the better. This relentless pursuit of improvement enhances my work and shapes my life, reminding me that every day holds the potential for progress.

I also believe that each challenge or difficult phase offers a valuable opportunity for growth and learning. Instead of seeing failure as an end, I perceive it as a stepping stone, an opportunity for improvement and reinvention where others may only see a dead end. In my journey of continuous improvement, I've learned that the most meaningful comparison is not with others but with who I was yesterday. This perspective drives me to constantly better myself, focusing on my individual growth rather than getting entangled in external competition.

## Hobbies

As a technical writer, I thrive on the diversity and richness my hobbies bring into my life. Traveling is my absolute favorite; it's like stepping into another world with different cultures and traditions I would never have encountered. Along my travels, I carry my trusted camera, [capturing fleeting moments and breathtaking sceneries](photo.mdx). Photography has taught me to appreciate details and perspectives, skills that have been invaluable in my writing. See some of my works on a *separate page*.

I also find immense joy in immersing myself in the study of art history. It's like a journey through time, a peek into human emotions and thoughts across different eras. This exploration has deepened my understanding of societal shifts and cultural influences, adding a unique perspective to my work. My fascination with art history is particularly piqued by the period leading up to the 1930s, where surrealism held sway. The captivating works of artists like Giorgio De Chirico and Ren√© Magritte, with their dreamlike landscapes and paradoxical images, have always been my favorites, stirring my imagination and influencing my perspective on the world.

Recently, I've embarked on a new musical journey-learning to play the harmonica, discovering a fun, casual pastime that fits right into my pocket. It's been an exciting endeavor so far, providing a refreshing break from my usual routine.
