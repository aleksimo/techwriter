I've been navigating the world of technical writing for nearly a decade. Over the years, I've come to see my role not just as a writer but as a translator, distilling complex information into accessible, user-friendly language. 

## Carreer

I earned my degree in the English Language, focusing on Translation and Interpreting. I began as a translator, helping people connect through language. My curiosity then led me to technical writing, where I blend my love for language with the tech world.

In this role I have handled documentation projects related to **game development, network and infrastructure, cloud technologies, and AI tools**. Each project allows me to adjust my writing style to meet the needs of different products and audiences.

My main goal is to **empower users with technology without overwhelming them**. I include **usability testing** and seek **user feedback** to create clear, user-friendly documentation. This approach helps simplify complex concepts and builds confidence in users.

To keep up with industry changes, I moved from traditional authoring tools like Help&Manual and Atlassian Confluence to the "**Docs as Code**" methodology. This shift promotes effective collaboration through **Git and CI/CD pipelines**. Tools like **Jira and Jira Align** help me track progress and meet deadlines consistently.

I also use graphic software like **Adobe Photoshop, DrawIO, and Snagit** to create engaging visuals. With tools like **MermaidJS**, I can write flow steps that turn into images when published.

With nine years of experience, I see technical writing as a way to help users use technology effectively. I look forward to applying my passion for clear and user-focused communication in future projects.

## Personality

As a technical writer, my career is fueled by **creativity** â€” a cornerstone of my professional identity and the engine behind my love for **collaborative ideation**. I find enrichment in **experimenting** with novel tools and methodologies, and balancing innovation with practicality, always searching for optimal work efficiency.

Resilience and **adaptability** are the by-products of my career, shaped by diverse environments and incidents, and **automation** has become an invaluable partner in this journey. Inspired by the Japanese philosophy of 'Kaizen' - **continuous improvement** - I tirelessly refine my skills and processes, embracing incremental enhancements as stepping stones towards progress.

Every **challenge serves as an opportunity** for growth, transforming perceived failures into catalysts for improvement and reinvention. I've learned the importance of self-reflection and the power of comparing only with my past self, favoring personal growth over external competition. This mindset propels me towards self-betterment, each day bringing new potential for progress.
