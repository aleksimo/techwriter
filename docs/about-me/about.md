Hello, I'm Aleksei (you can also call me Alex), and I've been navigating the world of technical writing for nearly a decade. Over the years, I've come to see my role not just as a writer but as a translator, distilling complex information into accessible, user-friendly language. I've made a career out of bridging the gap between technical experts and the consumers who use their innovations daily.

## Carreer

Starting with a degree in English Language, focusing on Translation and Interpreting, my journey has led me from a freelance translator to a proficient technical writer. This transition has equipped me to seamlessly interact with a diverse audience, from software developers and engineers to end-users.

Having worked on many projects in various product companies, including game development and AI tools, my portfolio spans internal and end-user guides, online help pages, and API documentation. Each project has served as an opportunity to sharpen my skills and adapt my writing style to various products and audiences.

My goal is to empower users with technology, not overwhelm them. This aim is achieved through integrating usability testing and user feedback, resulting in user-centric, straightforward documentation that demystifies complex technology.

Staying abreast of the latest trends and tools in the field, I've transitioned from using authoring tools like Help&Manual and Atlassian Confluence to adopting the "Docs as Code" methodology. This approach allows for efficient collaboration and transparency in the documentation process via Git and CI/CD.

Using such Project Management tools as Jira and Jira Align also helps me track the progress and consistently beat deadlines.

To further augment my written content, I've become proficient in graphic software like Adobe Photoshop, DrawIO, and Snagit, allowing me to create engaging visuals. I use diagramming tools such as MermaidJS to "write" flow steps, subsequently auto-rendered into images upon publishing.

With nine years of rich experience, I view technical writing as a quest to empower users to leverage technology effectively. I anticipate contributing my passion for clear, concise, and user-focused communication to future projects.

As a technical writer, I see **creativity** not as an optional attribute but as a vital part of my personality. It fuels my love for **collaborative brainstorming**, where diverse minds converge to create something truly unique. I find myself attracted to **trying new tools and approaches and experimenting** with different methodologies in a quest to enhance the efficiency of my work. In this constant pursuit, I aim to strike a **balance** between innovation and practicality, between tradition and the untried.

My career has required **quick adaptation** to incidents and varying environments, honing my resilience and flexibility. **Automation** has become my steadfast ally in this journey, preventing unnecessary repetition and giving me room to focus on new challenges. It aligns closely with the Japanese concept of '**Kaizen**', or continuous improvement. It resonates deeply with me as I constantly seek ways to refine my skills and processes, making small, incremental changes for the better. This relentless pursuit of improvement enhances my work and shapes my life, reminding me that every day holds the potential for progress.

I also believe that each challenge or difficult phase offers a valuable opportunity for growth and learning. Instead of seeing failure as an end, I perceive it as a stepping stone, an opportunity for improvement and reinvention where others may only see a dead end. In my journey of continuous improvement, I've learned that the most meaningful comparison is not with others but with who I was yesterday. This perspective drives me to constantly better myself, focusing on my individual growth rather than getting entangled in external competition. -->

## Hobbies

As a technical writer, I thrive on the diversity and richness my hobbies bring into my life. Traveling is my absolute favorite; it's like stepping into another world with different cultures and traditions I would never have encountered. Along my travels, I carry my trusted camera, [capturing fleeting moments and breathtaking sceneries](photo.mdx). Photography has taught me to appreciate details and perspectives, skills that have been invaluable in my writing. See some of my works on a *separate page*.

I also find immense joy in immersing myself in studying art history. It's like a journey through time, a peek into human emotions and thoughts across different eras. This exploration has deepened my understanding of societal shifts and cultural influences, adding a unique perspective to my work. My fascination with art history is particularly piqued by the period leading up to the 1930s, where surrealism held sway. The captivating works of artists like Giorgio De Chirico and René Magritte, with their dreamlike landscapes and paradoxical images, have always been my favorites, stirring my imagination and influencing my perspective on the world.

Recently, I've embarked on a new musical journey-learning to play the harmonica, discovering a fun, casual pastime that fits right into my pocket. It's been an exciting endeavor so far, providing a refreshing break from my usual routine.
