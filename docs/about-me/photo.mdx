Travelling is my favourite hobby. I carry my trusted camera along my journeys, capturing fleeting moments and breathtaking sceneries. Photography has taught me to appreciate details and perspectives, skills that have been invaluable in my writing.

Here are some of my works from Iceland, Greece, Georgia, Montenegro, Italy, and Poland.
